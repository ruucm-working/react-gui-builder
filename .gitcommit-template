# Allowed <type>
#   feat (feature)
#   pub (publishing)
#   fix (bug fix)
#   docs (documentation)

#   refactor
#   test (when adding missing tests)

# Examples
#   feat($browser): onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)

#   Added new event to $browser:
#   - forward popstate event if available
#   - forward hashchange event if popstate not available
#   - do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available

#   Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)
